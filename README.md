# Digisim_assignment_2
Solutions to the assignment 2.
Questions::
Simulate on Proteus: 

1) (Make one schematic for the entire problem)
  
  a) Take a number from 0 to 255 (8 bit) using logic-states and count the number of 1 bits  using a counter.

  b) Count the number of 1 bits at odd positions using a counter.(Indexing starts from 0 at LSB)

  Example- (11111110)2  == (254)10
  Number of 1 bits=7
  Number of 1 bits at odd position=4 (1,3,5,7)


2) Take a 7 bit number from 5-127 and add 5 to it in one clock cycle and divide by 2 in the next clock cycle alternately until it becomes 5. 
  Count the number of clock cycles it took to become 5 using a counter and display the output as logic probes.


3) A 2732 ROM has an array of 5 numbers, 0 <= each number <= 15. Find the sum of all the numbers and display the output as logic probes. 
    Run the python file to get the Ass_2.bin file or directly use the Ass_2.bin file given.

    Given array:- [10,2,9,3,15]


4) PCB Design Problem (ONLY FOR DIGISIM):

  Implement the PCB design for a full adder (1 bit for 1st yearites and 2 bit for 2nd yearites) 
  The PCB components selected should be of surface mount type. 
  U are free to use any company or ic number of the components , however sparkfun is recommended 
  PCB should have 2 layers top and bottom 
  Using Autorouter is allowed 
  U are also required to write ur name on the PCB 

  Take the screenshots of the schematic , board and Gerber file and upload them as well as the files on a folder in your drive or github repo. Submit the drive         link/github repo in the form with view access to everyone.
